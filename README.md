# Gate's Poem Game

This game is based on the Poem Game created by
Gate for play during Late Night JRChat.  However,
the game was so popular among its players that a
daytime version was needed and since JRChat is
often crowded during the day, a new place to play
it was needed that would not interfere with normal
chat in JRChat.  So I made this program.  =)

You don't know what those things are? Okay, well, back in the mid-1990s, there
was a series of video games called
[Creatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatures_(video_game_series)). These
games built up a small community, and eventually
[JRChat](https://creatures.wiki/JRChat) became the defacto standard place to
hang out. One community member came up with a text-based game to play in chat,
as it says above, and eventually [PoemGame](https://creatures.wiki/PoemGame)
was born!
